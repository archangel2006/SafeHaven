## 🌟 Why SafeHeaven?

🌪️ Disasters strike without warning - and information can mean survival.
Even today, millions still face chaos, misinformation, and slow response when help is needed most.

💡 SafeHeaven was built to change that.
It’s a global, open-source disaster management platform that unites:
- 🌍 AI intelligence for predicting and analyzing risks
- 🛰️ Satellite data for real-time disaster insights
- 👥 Community collaboration for on-ground accuracy

⚙️ Our mission:
To build technology that doesn’t just forecast danger - but actively protects lives.

❤️ This is more than just another tech project.
It’s a movement to use code for humanity and make safety a shared reality for everyone.

🚀 Join us in building tools that don’t just run in production - but save lives in the real world.
