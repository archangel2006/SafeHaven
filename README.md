# 🛡️ SafeHaven
### Find Safety. Report Hazards. Get Help.

🌟 Why SafeHeaven?

🌪️ Disasters strike without warning - and information can mean survival.
Yet even in 2025, millions still face chaos, misinformation, and delayed response when they need help the most.

💡 SafeHeaven was born to change that.

We’re building a disaster management platform that brings together
🌍 AI, 🛰️ satellite data, and 👥 community power - to make disaster response faster, smarter, and human-centered.

⚙️ Our mission?
To create technology that doesn’t just predict danger, but actually protects people.

❤️ This isn’t just another project - it’s an effort to use code for humanity, to make safety a shared reality for everyone.

🚀 Join us in building tools that don’t just run in production - but save lives in the real world.
